I'm a parent of a two year old, and I was pushed into hugo,(not the hurricane) by a sexy mentor of mine.

## More about me

I was an awful child myself once upon a time(Who could believe that, right?)  Well, every bad and awful thing i acted out and concocted as a child has come crashing back into my life in the form of my daughter.  She is the embodiment of me!  I hate sleeping, my daughter hates sleeping.  I am full of energy constantly, she has more!  I even chug coffee like it's going out of style, and still can't keep up!
